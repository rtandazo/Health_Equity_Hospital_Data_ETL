# **Health Equity Hospital Data ETL**

---

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **ETL process** for processing, cleaning, and transforming **CMS's Health Equity at the Hospital Level** dataset. The ETL process automates data preparation using **Python**, ensuring a structured and Tableau-ready format for analysis. The final output enables **geospatial mapping, performance benchmarking, and domain-level scoring insights** in a **Tableau dashboard**.

The analysis reveals **gaps in hospital participation and performance on health equity measures**, with **Domain 3 (Data Analysis) and Domain 5 (Leadership Engagement) emerging as the most failed domains nationwide**. Wyoming had the **lowest average score**, and states like **DC, DE, RI, VT, and CT had the lowest participation rates**. The findings highlight **systemic challenges in leadership accountability and data-driven equity efforts**.

## **Key Features**

### **Python ETL**
- **Automated Data Cleaning**:
  - Standardized **facility names** for uniformity
  - Ensured **ZIP codes** retained leading zeros for accurate geospatial mapping
  - Managed **missing data** where hospitals self-reported ‚ÄúNot Available‚Äù but still received perfect scores

- **Data Reshaping & Transformation**:
  - Reorganized the dataset to **pivot hospital domain scores** into an **analysis-friendly format**
  - Converted attestation responses into a structured **Yes/No binary system** for easier interpretation
  - Merged **hospital-level and state-level participation data** for Tableau integration

- **File Output for Analysis**:
  - **Final CSV Output**: `Health_Equity_Hospital_Clean.csv` (structured for direct Tableau ingestion)
  - **Log Messages**: Provides processing feedback and completion status
